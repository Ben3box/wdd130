It is bordered to the north by Rwanda, to the east and south by Tanzania, and to the west by the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The political capital is Gitega, while Bujumbura is the economic capital. The population is mainly composed of Hutus and Tutsis, with a minority of Twa. The country is known for its varied terrain, its green hills, high plateaus, and fertile valleys. The climate is tropical, with a dry season from May to August and a rainy season from November to May. Burundi is also known for its aquatic biodiversity, attracting biologists in search of rare species.</p>
